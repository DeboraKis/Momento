Momento
Momento is a web application that allows users to create "time capsules" â€” messages or memories that are locked until a specified date. You can write messages to your future self, store important memories, or leave behind personal notes. These time capsules remain locked until the set date arrives, at which point they are revealed to the user.

Features
Create Time Capsules: Write messages or memories and set a lock date.
Scheduled Unlocking: Time capsules remain locked until the specified date and time.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple design to help you quickly create, view, and manage your time capsules.
Multiple Capsules: Create as many time capsules as you like, each with its unique unlock date.
